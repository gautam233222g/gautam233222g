## Abstract

In the chaos of the implicit, a programmer who joins a team must have a common language and some rules in order to have an integration without friction.

There is a level 0, a common and accepted (or imposed by the architect) knowledge.

This document defines the concepts and guidelines to follow in order to be a developer who can work in a software team in 2013.

I think that you are already proficient with this notions.

We use PHP as language and Symofony2 as framework.
