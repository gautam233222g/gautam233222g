I was contacted by [leopro](https://twitter.com/_leopro_) ![_leopro_](https://en.gravatar.com/avatar/26d90e88b1eb694cc1276b9ab8d7630f?s=30)
who congratulated me for the excellent results obtained with the [StatsDClientBundle](https://github.com/liuggio/StatsDClientBundle).

Thanks to this comment I now know that [ServerGrove](http://blog.servergrove.com/2012/10/09/interesting-symfony-bundles-statsdclientbundle/) chosen [StatsD Client Bundle](https://github.com/liuggio/StatsDClientBundle) as its top choice for Symfony2 project among more than 1600.

    There are well over 1600 public bundles at knpbundles.com, so sometimes really interesting and good bundles are hard time find. So we will revive the old series but this time we will do it with bundles.
    In our first installment of the series we will present StatsDClientBundle written by Giulio De Donato. `

Anyone who follows a conference in europe about web developing or PHP knows [ServerGrove](http://blog.servergrove.com/2012/10/09/interesting-symfony-bundles-statsdclientbundle/), I thank them.
