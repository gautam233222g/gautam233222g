It is a shame I never had energy to continue the BDD saga started with:
[phpunit-vs-phpspec-theory-on-behaviour-driven-development 1/3](http://welcometothebundle.com/phpunit-vs-phpspec-theory-on-behaviour-driven-development)

During our monthly meeting at [Pug Roma](http://roma.grusp.org/2013/03/incontro-di-febbraio-2013/),
I have talked about php-spec and behaviour driven development.
