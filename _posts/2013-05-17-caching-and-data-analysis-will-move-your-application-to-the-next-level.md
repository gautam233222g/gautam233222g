### If you don't ignore data you could find a business value.

The presentation focuses on data analysis, how to track and measure applications and why the use of software metrics that push information are essential.

Delegates will be shown practical examples of how Terravision uses Statsd, Sentry versus Graylog for the error behavior analysis of users, applications, operating systems and web servers.

The final part of the presentation concludes with methodologies of advanced scalability, events, messages and queues.
